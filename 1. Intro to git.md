# Intro to git

## What is git?

The world's most popular version control system (VCS)

### What is Version Control System (VCS)?

It is software that tracks and manage changes made to files and directories over time.

It allow users to revist previous versions of their files and directories, compare changes between different versions, undo changes and many other things.

### git is just one of the VCS

git is just one of the many version control systems available in the market today. Other well-knowns include

- subversion
- CVS

They all have similar goals, but vary significantly in how they achieve those goals. Fortunately, we only need to care about git.

## Why git?

- It track changes across multiple files and directories
- Compare previous versions of a project
- Revert back to a previous old versions of project like "time travel in past"
- Collaboration and share changes between the team
- Combine changes made by different people on single project.

## History of git

- Linus Torvalds, the creator of the git as free and open source vcs.
- He is a Legendary software engineer, who created Linux and git.
- In 2005, he got frustrated with available vcs because they are slow, paid and close source.
- So, he decided to create his own vcs in April 2005.

### Behind the Name

Linus Torvalds refered git as a "Stupid content tracker" while he was working on it.

## Difference between git and github

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - It is the Version Control Software (VCS) that runs locally on your machine | - It is a service that hosts git repositories on cloud and make esaier to collaborate. |
| - No internet connection Required                                            | - Internet connection required                                                         |
| - No account required                                                        | - account required                                                                     |

## Ways of Using git

1. Through GUI Software
2. Through Terminal

### using GUI Clients

These are the software/clients that represent git workflow in graphical representation.
for example git kraken, etc.

| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - More Easier to get started for beginners | - There is lot of magic involved in inner working that hidden away with GUI. |
| - More user friendly and easy to use       | - It leads to dependency on GUI software                                     |
| - Some people prefer visual interface      | - More difficult to fix things when goes wrong                               |
| - Don't need to learn any commands         | - But complex tasks achieved through terminal only                           |

### using Terminal

Any linux terminal will do the work with git. Even when we install it gave us the bash terminal to interact with git.

| pros                                                                | cons                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| - Officially, git is command line based tool                        | - Not user friendly                            |
| - It is faster when you're comfortable with it                      | - Require to remember some git commmands       |
| - Some more advance git features are only available on command line | - Beginer doesn't require advance git features |
| - It is machine independent                                         | - It will seem overwhelming at the begining    |
